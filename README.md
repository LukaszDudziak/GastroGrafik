# GastroGrafik

This app was my final project in CodersLab bootcamp. It was inspired by my previous job, as a club manager, where I was responsible for creating work schedule for bartenders. 

For now it contains a simple menu from where you can manage employees and their disposition; set place's opening days, and number of needed bartenders; and finally, set the schedule based on workers disposition and days when the pub is open, and automatically, after that send email to all employees with new schedule.
